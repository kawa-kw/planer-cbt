# Project Guidelines

## Git Workflow
- When creating a new branch, ALWAYS `git fetch origin` and `git checkout main` (or the default branch) first to ensure the new branch is based on the latest code.
- New pull requests should always target `main`, unless the user specifies a different target branch.
